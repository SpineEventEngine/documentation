# Welcome to Spine Documentation repository

This repository serves for two purposes:

2. Gathering issues improving the documentation of the framework and tasks on writing articles at spine.io and other web resources.

We have repository for the code of [spine.io](https://spine.io) site. Issues there are for improving the site features. 

Tasks for the content of the [spine.io](https://spine.io) site should belong to issues of _this_ repository.
