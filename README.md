# Welcome to Spine Documentation repository

This repository serves for three purposes:

1. The [Wiki](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/documentation/wiki) provides documentation for developers contributing to the framework, Commiters.
2. Gathering issues improving the documentation of the framework and tasks on writing articles at spine.io and other web resources.
3. Storing documentation files that are added as a submodule to the [SpineEventEngine.github.io](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/SpineEventEngine.github.io) repository.

We have repository for the code of [spine.io](https://spine.io) site. Issues there are for improving the site features. 

Tasks for the content of the [spine.io](https://spine.io) site should belong to issues of _this_ repository.
